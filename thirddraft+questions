###Working Title: The Indifferent Photograph

On December 12th, 2013 Liora Hess received a package in the mail. Opening up a box postmarked from Sweden, she found a small device about the size of a postage stamp. After flipping through the user’s manual and charging the gadget, she clipped it to her blouse and headed out of her stuccoed studio in outer Los Angeles. She had just bought a Narrative Clip, one of the first "lifelogging" cameras to be released for consumer use. Throughout the day the camera automatically took a picture every thirty seconds, capturing her eating sushi with her boyfriend Doug and following up on a Craiglist ad for exotic cacti in downtown LA. On her way home she stopped by the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple where, remembering the instructions in the user manual, she double tapped the front of the device to capture parts of the courtyard she found particularly striking. Upon arriving back home, Liora uploaded the photos onto her laptop which were soon pushed to an application on her phone. There, lined up in chronological order, was a photographic journal of her day; Doug grabbing a bite of her salad, a tortoise she almost stepped on at the cacti nursery, Bakan Lama waiving her goodbye from the temple. She quickly discovered a feature called “Moment Trim” which selected images with new faces and favorable lighting, and grouped them together in an attempt to isolate the moments in her day. The feature was surprisingly effective in narrowing down noteworthy pictures, but she found that it didn’t include all the images she thought were interesting. After more searching through the minutiae of her day, Liora got sleepy and set the Narrative Clip facedown on her desk, turning it off. What she had just put down was not simply a novelty gadget, but part of a new wave of lifelogging devices that have been finding homes in a fast-growing community of people committed to recording and cataloging every aspect of their everyday life.

For much of the 80s and 90s, lifelogging was a fringe hobby of the technological savvy, pioneered by the Canadian inventor Steve Mann, who since 1980 has been wearing a permanently fixed video camera, that records and wirelessly transmits video twenty-four-seven (give source). Deemed the “father of wearable computing” (give source), Mann’s cyborg-like devices became increasingly less wiry and more portable over the years, inspiring others to follow suit. By 2004, Microsoft had released an experimental wearable camera about the size of a smart-phone that was worn around the neck as a lanyard (give source). Still in the confines of tech giants’ research labs and MIT doctoral experiments, lifelogging cameras started to pique the interest of the general public, and by 2012, a Swedish company named Memoto (later renamed to Narrative) had been founded and was on its way to producing one of the first commercial wearable cameras. Backed by a half-million dollar Kickstarter campaign, Memoto launched a camera in late 2013, joining the company of Autographer, another wearable lifelogging camera that had been released earlier in the year. Not isolated phenomena, these lifelogging cameras are part of a wider movement of digital self-recording and self-tracking known as the Quantified Self movement.

In 2007, Wired Magazine editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly introduced the term “quantified self” as a “collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking.” (give source) Over the past eight years the term has blossomed into a movement with communities of “self-quantifiers” in 112 cities around the world (source). Using the online platform Meetup, they regularly get together for talks and demonstrations of new software and devices that allow them to better track and record their lives. From recording sleep patterns to calories, photographs to moods, the QS community is committed to quantifying and logging their behaviors and habits, in order to gain an increased self-awareness. The Narrative Clip is closely tied with the Quantified Self movement and is even listed as a supporter of QS on the community's main website (http://quantifiedself.com/friends/), however, the movement as a whole extends beyond the photographic leanings of the Narrative, and connects together people from joggers to bio-hackers, all seeking to use technology to track and archive their everyday activities. As a manifestation of this movement, the Narrative Clip presents a moment where photography is being adapted and redefined to fit a new desire to constantly self-record. In its new form, on the blouses and lapels of the technologically literate, lifelogging cameras like the Narrative Clip are changing the way we take pictures and the way we think about them as well.

Traditionally, photography is the act of framing the world in a way that portrays the photographer's expectations or desires about the way things should look. Susan Sontag speaks to this in her seminal book, *On Photography*, where she notes, "even when photographers are most concerned with mirroring reality, they are still haunted by tacit imperatives of taste and conscience. The immensely gifted members of the Farm Security Administration photographic project of the the late 1930s (among them Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Ben Shahn, Russell Lee) would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the right look on film -- the precise expression on the subject's face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, exploitation, and geometry." (Sontag, 6) In this light, photography appears as not merely a reduplication of the world but a conscious framing of it that puts forth certain imperatives about the way it should be perceived. This type of deliberate, message-focused photography seems to stand in opposition to the photographs the Narrative Clip takes. With the Narrative, the camera takes pictures by itself, its frame determined not by a steady hand, but the whim of the lapel which it is clipped to. It is a photography that is fascinated with recording and cataloging everything, for the sake of having everything, and not in order to produce beautiful, artistic, or politically-charged visions of the world. What can be seen emerging are two distinct forms of photography; one which can be called the *agentic*, is the intentional, artistic, frame-oriented photography that Sontag points to, where the photographer has *agency* over the photograph and its semantic potential. The other form, which can be called the *archival*, is a photography based on using photos as a means to catalog, remember, and archive parts of the world. It is a photography which takes away emphasis from the act of taking the picture, and puts it instead on a mass accumulation of images to remember the world by. This distinction showed it self to Sontag as well who compared "virtuosi of the noble image like Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand, composing mighty, unforgettable photographs decade after decade," to "the Polaroid owner for whom photographs are a handy, fast form of note-taking, or the shutter-bug with a Brownie who takes snapshots as souvenirs of daily life." (Sontag, 6) It is not that these two types of photography are new, but that with the increasing miniaturization and portability of photographic devices - emblematized by the advent of the Narrative Clip - the contrast between them has grown sharper.

Cellphones with built-in cameras have become a standard in the past ten years, and thus have allowed a large majority of populations constant access to a photographic device. Along with birthing the social phenomenon of the selfie, this widespread exposure has led people to use cameras more frequently and in new ways. Presently, it is common occurrence for people to take a picture of a bus schedule, recipe, or advertisement as a way of remembering something they would have otherwise used a written note for. Whereas before digital photography, images - save that of the Polaroid's - would have taken hours or days to be processed, now photographs can be instantly taken and available on the same device that is used for all other major communications. On top of this, there is no longer the sense that every picture taken is an economic expenditure. Whereas twenty years ago, people may have been prudent about what pictures they took and when, today, photographs are taken freely, without the moderation and intentionality that felt necessary when each picture was an expense. This change has taken archival photography from the niche enclaves of museum cataloging and Polaroid-enthusiasts, and turned it into a widespread cultural practice. The Narrative Clip is the farthest extension of this movement, and an eye into the ways in which photography is being increasingly transformed into a tool for memory.

On the Narrative website, a large tag-line covers the home page:

*A new kind of photographic memory: The Narrative Clip is a tiny, automatic camera and app that gives you a searchable and shareable photographic memory.* (give source)

The emphasis of the device it seems, is not to function as a traditional camera, but instead to produce "automatic" pictures that can make up a "photographic memory." The creators behind Narrative want users to clip the camera on and forget about it for the rest of the day. A little further down on the page another line reads: "you won't even notice it's there." Whereas agentic photography puts the camera into the forefront, focusing on how it is framing the subject, the archival photography being popularized by Narrative diminishes the role of the camera as much as possible. It is instead a constant memory-capturing device whose mission is to make the wide, and often mundane expanses of our day, "searchable and shareable." In the search for memory then, photography becomes less about capturing images, and more about retrieving them. As the case of Liora Hess showed, the user of the Narrative Clip at the end of the day plugs the camera into the computer, whereby the photos are downloaded and sent to an application on their phone. There, organized chronologically, are thousands of images, separated into time blocks the application's smart algorithms view as distinct "moments." The real task of the user then, is not to take pictures, but to look back at them. Photography ceases to be about capturing photos at all, and turns into a database that people look back into when they want to remember something. Whereas twenty or thirty years ago the activity of the art photographer and the Polaroid snap shooter could without hesitation both be called photography, today devices like the Narrative are posing problems for this seemingly monolithic category. It seems that by turning photography into an act of retrieval, lifelogging cameras are transforming the camera into less of a device, and more of an organ.

Like human memory, the Narrative Clip constantly takes in and stores information. Whereas the point and shoot camera needs to be put between the eye and the action - an interruption within daily experience - the Narrative constantly captures what is going on, without requiring the user to stop what they are doing. In talking about the way tourists take pictures, Sontag writes, "most tourists feel compelled to put the camera between themselves and whatever is remarkable that they encounter...[the] photograph is not just the result of an encounter between an event and a photographer; picture taking is an event in itself..." (Sontag, 11) Sontag shows how the very act of photographing requires a distancing of the self from the action - it is an event that removes one from the action they are attempting to capture. The Narrative Clip on the other hand is always on and thus indifferently records experience as it unfolds. As the company's website proclaims: "Capture the moment as it happens, without interference. Complement your staged photos of majestic scenery with the intensity of the small moments that matter the most." (Give source) This line creates a divide between "staged" agentic photography and the spontaneous archival photography of the Narrative, while suggesting that the device should not be used as tool, but instead a way of living life more "intens[ly]." In this way, the Narrative is set up to be an appendage of the body that allows us to have an even richer memory. With the increasing portability of technology, the camera itself has blurred the line between instrument and organ and is becoming a permanent fixture of how people are perceiving and remembering their everyday life.

In the few days after Liora starting using the Narrative Clip, she began to notice that most of the pictures it took were blurry. Instead of a clear frame-by-frame narrative of her commute to work, the camera picked up odd angles of the sky and blurred streaks of her surroundings. Although initially she had been excited about the prospect of cataloging her entire life in photos, now the endeavor seemed slightly underwhelming. It seemed to her that the camera was skewing the moments she had sought out to remember. By trying to use photography automatically, as some sort of organ that functioned without her conscious thought, the camera began to produce pictures that hid more from her daily life than they showed. The strangest thing was that Liora started to confuse pictures and memory. Whereas the lived experience of walking by a garage sale last Wednesday had disappeared, she remembered the picture the Narrative Clip had taken as a memory. She couldn't tell if the memory of a kid playing with a Tonka truck in front of the garage sale was just a copy of the photo, or if she was really recalling that instance. Instead of strengthening her own memory, it was as if the Narrative was acting as a surrogate memory. This focus on creating an electronic memory has been one of the main causes of lifelogging, and something pioneered by one its main proponent's Gordon Bell...

Bring in Gordon Bell, emphasis on recording everything/e-memory. This electronic memory carries the same dangers of the photograph in that it pretends to be real, but it is a distortion. 

This emphases on living "more", being able to experience the real was of specific interest to the Italian neo-realists, who going against formalists and proponents of montage like Eisentstein, wanted to "put camera in the street". The narrative clip has brought out their desire to a conclusion but it appears that its result, in its banality and blurriness, is just as much of a distortion of reality as the formalists they were critiquing.






"Most important moments where the ones you didn't realize were moments." The trouble is that this grainy, imprecise photography is not well suited to capture life's moments, especially the spontaneous ones.

"What if you could relive any moment of your life?"



1) Blurry photos, underwhelming version of reality
3) Broader point present in this discussion: all technology is going to distort our experience

HOW IS THE NARRATIVE CLIP AND ARCHIVAL PHOTOGRAPHY DISTORTING OUR EXPERIENCE DIFFERENTLY..?

The issue is that the Narrative doesn't capture your everyday life all that well, usually made of shots of the floor and blurry pictures of your commute. While purporting to create a photographic memory, it actually creates versions of your life that hide more about it then they show. This new kind of archival photography creates a selective memory that is comprised of blurry renditions of your actual life. The devices that try to get us closer to "realism" actually distort our lives (use neo-realist screenwriter qoute). Device trying to make a narrative out of our lives, cut out pictures, create moments -> can't escape the desire to trim and curate the way life looks. There is no such thing as non-distortion of reality. Realism is always a way of distorting...


Technology and its capacity to represent our experience....


Conclude with broader point on representation and realism. Does this give us a more authentic view of everyday life?






**Feeling that we remember a photographic and not the memory.**

The great claims of this technology arent that novel, 




Papa's advice:


I need to be critical of the memories this device is creating. Maybe they are false memories?



Blurry pictures, pictures of floor - actually Narrative fails to create real memories.

 

The dream of capturing everyday life is kinda boring. Portrays a less "real" reality.

Neo-realist screenwriter said he wanted to put camera in street, use this

**The technology that's made to connect to our lives better actually disconnects us from them.**



Rhetoric of movement is easiest target of showing that it's not doing this.


Is it archival photography really that non-agentic?

New type of agency...where you position it/how you look at photos.

Not quantified self, its a **qualified self**

Go back to idea of "momentification" "moment trim"



Talk about sensation of photograph creating a memory when there is none. What does it mean to be relying on "indifferent photographs" to create our memories? 

Go into Gordon Bell/lifelogging/total recall
Show how this search for total recall actually dilutes our memories in some ways



Questions:

1) Is distinction between agentic and archival photography contrived? Does it appear amateur that I am offering these terms or are they useful?

2) Are there any moments/paragraphs that lose you?

3) Should I proceed as such: introduce the idea of total recall and Gordon Bell, briefly mention how this idea of "total" is related to "total opera" and "total football," show how despite trying to create a total, "photographic memory", the Narrative creates blurry and and ultimately false representations of our daily life. The consequence of this is that in the search of total memory, we end up introducing technologies that create illusory memories that do carry the same significance as the ones we create naturally. Critique notion of photograph = memory.
