###Narrative Clip Description

The Narrative Clip is a wearable camera that measures about the size of a postage stamp. A simple square with a clip in the back, it clips onto jacket lapels and takes a picture every thirty seconds. Double-tapping the front both shows the battery level and takes a picture, making it possible to capture images outside the 30-second interval. The camera has GPS, which tags each picture to the location where it was taken. The device also automatically reorients the image right side up, regardless of what side it is on. Although there is no off button, the Narrative can be shut off by placing it down on a table or putting it in a pocket.

The device syncs all of its content with your computer and then sends that to the Narrative cloud, which organizes all of your pictures by time and location. These can then be viewed chronologically on your phone, a moment-by-moment visual essay of your day. The app also scans through your photos and selects images which have striking contrast or new faces, and then catalogs them as moments, making it easy to find the new places and people you saw throughout your day. 

Narrative, formerly known as Memoto, is a Swedish company which raised funding for production in 2013 through Kickstarter. With plans to add wireless photo upload to phones and offer attachable lens in 2014, they represent the leader in wearable photo lifelogging devices.
